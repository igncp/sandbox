# Sandbox

A repository to study external projects. The key points are:

- **Automation**: Automate as much as possible, even the trivial things
- **Performance**: Don't do the same twice if it was already done or can be done once and saved in memory / disk
- **No interdependencies**: Keep it simple, even if that means more code repetition for sections that may change in the future
- **One state**: Running the scripts twice or more should result in the same state as running them once

Some of the commands used to explore the projects are from [the explorers repository](https://github.com/igncp/explorers).

## Projects

The projects are sorted from more to less recently updated:
