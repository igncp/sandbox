# Sandbox

A repository to study external projects. The key points are:

- Automation: Automate as much as possible, even the trivial things
- Performance: Don't do the same twice if it was already done or can be done once and saved in memory / disk
- Few interdependencies: Keep it simple, even if that means more code repetition for sections that may change in the future
- Idempotent scripts: Try to reach as many idempotent commands as possible
